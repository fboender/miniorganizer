Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

MiniOrganizer requires the following software in order to run properly:

* Python (v2.4+) (http://python.org/download/[])
* Python GTK-2 bindings (http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html[])
* Python DateUtil 
* Python Glade2

Instructions - Ubuntu / Debian
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to install MiniOrganizer on an Ubuntu or Debian system, follow these steps:

Python should already be installed on your system. If you're using a reasonably
up-to-date system, it should also be the correct version (v2.4 or higher). So
the first thing to do is install the required Python libraries. 

Use your package manager to install the following Ubuntu/Debian packages: 

* python-gtk2
* python-glade2
* python-dateutil

For the commandline based Aptitude, this would be:

 sudo aptitude install python-gtk2 python-glade2 python-dateutil

Now follow the general instructions mentioned below.

Instructions - General
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now download the MiniOrganizer tarball from the MiniOrganizer homepage and
unpack it using your archive manager. For the commandline:

 tar -vxzf miniorganizer-*.tar.gz

Change to the unarchived directory, and run 'setup.sh':

 cd miniorganizer-*/
 ./setup.sh

This will install MiniOrganizer in the '/usr/local/share/miniorganizer'
directory. Links to the binaries will be installed in '/usr/local/bin/'.

MiniOrganizer Alarm daemon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MiniOrganizer Alarm daemon (The +miniorganizer-daemon+ executable) is the MiniOrganizer alarm notifier. When run, it docks in your desktop's notification area and shows alerts when an appointment or todo's alarm goes off. Clicking the icon in the notification area of your desktop will launch the main MiniOrganizer interface.
