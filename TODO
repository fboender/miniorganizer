miniorganizer 		Under a raw installation of Debian (4.0), miniorganizer reports various bugs. Fix these.
miniorganizer 		An event which is a whole day event, and which runs from 06/13/08 to 06/16/08 doesn't appear in the calendar on the 16th (because it ends on 06/16/08 at 00:00).
miniorganizer 		When starting with a higher debug level, it appears that Python suddenly gives warnings about kgetattr being deprecated and that you should use a property. Annotations about this are available in the source. It should be fixed.
config				Create when not exists with defaults.
notifier			Ability to dock in the gnome panel (should also work without gnome though).
