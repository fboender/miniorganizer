The Column class checks to see if data_type is None, and if it is, it transforms it into the 'str' data type. I've modified the constructor to have 'str' be the default data_type instead of None and removed the special check for None.

The ColoredColumn class did a check to see if the data_type was 'int'. This meant ColoredColumn only worked for 'int' columns. The patch removes the check as ColoredColumn works just fine with 'str', 'int', 'datetime.datetime' and probably other data types. 

In order to make ColeredColumn more like the normal Column class, this patch also sets the default data_type of ColoredColumn to 'str'.
